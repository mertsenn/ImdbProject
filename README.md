# ImdbProject
# IMDb Clone

In this project, I have created a movie listing and detail viewing application similar to IMDb. The application was developed using Kotlin programming language and incorporates modern app development techniques for Android.

## Features

- Movies can be displayed in a paginated list.
- The movie list is presented in two different layout styles: list view and grid view.
- Detailed information about a movie can be accessed by clicking on it.
- Movie details are fetched from an API and displayed in the application.
- The movie's trailer can be viewed within the application.
- Movies can be searched by their titles.

## Used Libraries

- **Android Jetpack**: Android Jetpack components include essential elements for Android app development, such as Room, Navigation, and LiveData.

- **Glide**: A popular library for loading and displaying images.

- **Retrofit**: A library used for making HTTP requests and fetching data from APIs.

- **Dagger Hilt**: Dependency injection library used in the project.

- **Paging 3.0**: An Android Jetpack component used for pagination.

- **JUnit and Espresso**: Testing libraries used for writing unit and UI tests.
